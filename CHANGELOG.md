# Changelog

## Unreleased

Initial skeleton — nothing has been released, so everything below is new.

- `contour index [PATH]` scans a git checkout and indexes every Ruby callable
  in it. Facts are keyed by git blob OID, so N worktrees of one repo cost one
  index and a reindex with no edits parses nothing.
- `contour --symbols FILE` outlines one file's callables, parsing it live. No
  index required, and it works in a directory contour has never seen.
- `contour --status` reports what the index holds, whether a checkout may be
  stale, and summary coverage (`none` until milestone 3).
- Every method carries a `norm_hash`: a structural hash of its normalized
  body, with locals and positional parameters renamed to ordinals and layout,
  comments, quoting style and numeric spelling collapsed. Keyword parameter
  names are kept — they are what a caller writes.
- `contour dupes [SCOPE]` reports units whose normalized bodies are identical.
  `--min-lines` (default 4) hides bodies too short for structural identity to
  mean duplication.
- Index lives at `~/.local/share/contour/contour.db`; `$CONTOUR_DB` overrides
  it. There are no migrations — a schema-version mismatch drops the database
  and reindexes, because it is a cache of a pure function, not a system of
  record.
